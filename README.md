# Sentiment Analysis of Twitter

![Sentiment Analysis Visualization](twitter_image.webp)


This repository showcases a robust pipeline for **sentiment analysis on Twitter data** using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project processes over **10,000 tweets**, performing advanced data processing, model building, and deployment through a Flask web application. It serves as a comprehensive framework for automating the various stages of machine learning workflows, from data ingestion to deployment.


## **Project Overview**

### **Key Features**
- **Data Pipeline Automation**: 
  - Seamless integration of data ingestion, validation, feature engineering, and feature extraction.
  - Ensures data quality and consistency throughout the pipeline.

- **Machine Learning Workflow**:
  - Cross-validation to select the best model.
  - Final training pipeline that builds and optimizes the sentiment analysis model.
  - Model evaluation to assess performance on unseen data.

- **Deployment Ready**:
  - A Flask web application (`app.py`) is included in the `deployment` folder to enable easy deployment and interaction with the sentiment analysis model.

### **Use Case**
The project analyzes sentiments from tweets, which can be used in applications like:
- **Customer Sentiment Monitoring**: Understanding public opinion about products or services.
- **Event Analysis**: Gauging sentiment trends during significant events.
- **Social Media Insights**: Tracking mood changes on specific topics or hashtags.

### **Set Up Your Environment**

1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**:
   A virtual environment ensures isolated dependency management and prevents conflicts with other projects.
   ```bash
   conda create -p saenv
 
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   Install all necessary Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **How to Use the Project**

1. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - The project includes trigger files to run various stages of the ML pipeline.
   - Execute the cross-validation process:
     ```bash
     python execute_cross_validation.py
     ```
   - For the final training pipeline:
     ```bash
     python execute_final_model_training.py
     ```
   These scripts cover:
   - Data ingestion and validation
   - Feature engineering and extraction
   - Cross-validation and model selection
   - Final model training and evaluation

2. **Deployment**:
   - Navigate to the deployment folder and run the Flask app:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Access the application to interact with the sentiment analysis model.
